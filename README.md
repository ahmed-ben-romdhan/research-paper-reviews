üìå About Me

My name is Ahmed Ben Romdhane, and I am a Tunisian student deeply passionate about mathematics, logic, and physics. I graduated with an excellent score of 17.69/20 in the Baccalaur√©at, earning the highest distinction, ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. Following this, I completed two years of intensive classes pr√©paratoires scientifiques (MPSI/MP*), part of the highly selective French preparatory system.

During these two years, I studied a broad and rigorous curriculum, including:
üîπ Mathematics:

    Algebra (linear, multilinear, abstract)

    Real and complex analysis

    Euclidean and affine geometry

    Differential equations (ODEs and PDEs)

    Probability and statistics

    Discrete mathematics and logic

    Sequences, series, and convergence

    Numerical methods and algorithmic thinking

    Topology and vector spaces

    Optimization and convexity

üîπ Physics:

    Classical mechanics (Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian formalisms)

    Electromagnetism (Maxwell‚Äôs equations, circuits, fields)

    Thermodynamics and statistical physics

    Quantum physics (wave functions, Schr√∂dinger equation)

    Optics (geometrical and wave)

    Fluid mechanics

    Solid-state physics (introductory)

    Acoustics and wave propagation

üîπ Other Subjects:

    Automatic control systems and signal processing

    Chemistry (general, organic, and physical chemistry)

    Computer science (Python, data structures, algorithmic logic)

    Engineering fundamentals

After these studies, I ranked 30th nationwide out of approximately 1,800 candidates in Tunisia‚Äôs competitive national entrance exam and was admitted to √âcole Polytechnique de Tunisie, the country‚Äôs most selective engineering school.
üéØ Purpose of This Repository

I built this repository as a research journal and learning log, with the goal to:

    Review and summarize advanced research papers in applied mathematics and physics

    Explore, analyze, and possibly improve theoretical or empirical approaches

    Train myself to think like a researcher by critically engaging with literature

    Write structured reports on the topics I study

    Identify the research direction I wish to pursue in the coming years

Although my current path is broad and polytechnic in nature, I will choose a specialization in my final year. This three-year engineering program is equivalent to a master's degree in engineering, and combined with my pr√©pa background, provides a strong base in both mathematical and physical sciences.

I am currently in my second year of engineering studies and am open to any research opportunities ‚Äî remote or on-site, paid or unpaid ‚Äî as part of my undergraduate learning journey. I am enthusiastic, driven, and eager to contribute meaningfully to academic or applied research projects.
